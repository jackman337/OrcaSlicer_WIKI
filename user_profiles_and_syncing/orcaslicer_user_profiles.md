## Storage Location

OrcaSlicer stores user profiles in the application's configuration directory. The exact location depends on your operating system:

| OS | Typical Path |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\OrcaSlicer` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/OrcaSlicer` |
| Linux (AppImage / native) | `~/.config/OrcaSlicer` |
| Linux (Flatpak) | `~/.var/app/com.orcaslicer.OrcaSlicer/config/OrcaSlicer` |

Reinstalling OrcaSlicer does **not** delete these profiles, so your settings and custom presets are preserved across updates.

> [!WARNING]
> On macOS, uninstalling OrcaSlicer may prompt you to delete the configuration directory. If you confirm, **all your user profiles will be permanently lost**. Only delete this directory if you are sure you no longer need your profiles.

## Finding the Configuration Folder

You can open the configuration folder directly from within OrcaSlicer:

1. Go to the menu bar and click **Help** > **Show Configuration Folder**.

![find_configuration_folder](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer_WIKI/blob/main/images/user_profiles_and_syncing/find_configuration_folder.png?raw=true)

## User Profile Folders

Inside the configuration folder, you will find a subfolder named `user`. This folder contains all your custom presets and user profiles.

![user_folder](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer_WIKI/blob/main/images/user_profiles_and_syncing/user_folder.png?raw=true)

The `user` directory may contain one or more of the following subfolders:

### `default`

This is the folder OrcaSlicer uses when you are **not** logged into any cloud syncing service. It is typically the only folder present if you have never used profile syncing.

### `<UUID>` (OrcaCloud)

A folder named with a UUID (e.g., `6b89c630-39bb-42cb-a1f0-476bef493c06`). This folder is created when you sign in to **OrcaCloud** (available from version 2.4 onwards). When you are logged in, OrcaSlicer automatically saves and loads your custom presets from this folder instead of `default`.

### `<10-digit number>` (Bambu Cloud)

A folder named with a 10-digit number (e.g., `1509812367`). This folder was used by the legacy **Bambu Cloud** profile syncing feature.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting from OrcaSlicer 2.4, Bambu Cloud is no longer supported for profile syncing. It has been replaced by OrcaCloud. Bambu Cloud for printer communication is unaffected.

### How OrcaSlicer Chooses a Folder

- **Logged into OrcaCloud** → uses the UUID folder
- **Not logged in** → uses the `default` folder

Switching login state automatically switches the active folder. No manual action is needed.

## OrcaCloud Auto Migration

Starting from version 2.4, OrcaSlicer includes an automatic migration feature to help you transition to OrcaCloud.

When you sign in to OrcaCloud for the **first time**, OrcaSlicer automatically copies your existing profiles from the `default` or Bambu Cloud folder into the new UUID-based folder. This means your custom presets are preserved and synced to the cloud without any manual steps.

> [!TIP]
> After migration, you can verify your profiles are backed up by visiting [cloud.orcaslicer.com](https://cloud.orcaslicer.com) and signing in with your account.

## Manual Migration

In most cases, the auto migration works smoothly. However, if your profiles do not appear after signing in to OrcaCloud, you can manually migrate them:

1. Copy the contents of your old profile folder (`default` or the 10-digit Bambu Cloud folder) into the new UUID folder.
2. Restart OrcaSlicer.
3. Wait 1–3 minutes for OrcaSlicer to detect the new profiles and sync them to OrcaCloud.
