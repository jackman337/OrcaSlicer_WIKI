# What's Changed

This is the OrcaSlicer V2.4.0 Beta. A lot of effort has gone into this release to improve stability, speed, and print quality, along with the interface and printer support. Bridging in particular has been greatly improved by @ianalexis, @kisslorand, and many others, and a new realistic rendering option from @RF47 makes your models look gorgeous right inside OrcaSlicer.

There's good news for multi-material users too: per-feature filament assignment got a big upgrade, opening up much more creative prints. Ever thought about printing the outer walls in TPU and the rest in PLA? Now you can — check out the details below.


**Note:** Everything from the 2.4.0 Alpha — Orca Cloud, Z Anti-Aliasing (ZAA) contouring, Machine Input Shaping, Optimized Gyroid infill, and the redesigned printer selection dialog — is included in this build. See the [2.4.0 Alpha release notes](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/releases/tag/v2.4.0-alpha) for details on those.

# 🌊 New Features & Improvements

* **Realistic View: Phong shading, ambient occlusion, and cast shadows** by @RF47 in [13704](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13704)
    Adds a new set of rendering options to the 3D canvas, letting you switch between the classic Gouraud shader and a new Phong shader and layer on SSAO ambient occlusion and cast shadows. The result is a far more realistic, depth-rich preview of your models. Reflections (Phong) and cast shadows are available in prepare mode.

    | Gouraud | Gouraud + SSAO | Gouraud + SSAO + Shadows |

* **Configurable lightning infill angles** by @RF47 in [13848](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13848), with wiki documentation by @ianalexis in [13984](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13984)
    Exposes three new expert-mode settings for lightning infill: the overhang angle (how far walls can support the layer above), the prune angle (how aggressively short unsupported branches are removed), and the straightening angle (how far branches can be simplified). These give finer control over how lightning infill is generated. Fixes #13758.

* **Double-click an object list row to frame it in the 3D view** by @RJAudas in [13804](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13804)
    Adds Blender-style "Frame Selected" behavior to the object list: double-clicking an object, part, or instance row in the left panel now frames that item in the 3D view while preserving the current view angle. It is the same camera move as the existing "Fit camera to scene or selected object" toolbar button, just exposed through a more natural trigger. The action is inert in slice-preview mode. Resolves #13800.

* **Preview sliders overhaul** by @kisslorand in [13919](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13919)
    A comprehensive refresh of the layer preview sliders. The layer labels next to the vertical slider are now fully interactive — you can click and drag them directly for a much larger interaction target, they highlight on hover, and clicking preserves the current position instead of jumping. Both vertical and horizontal sliders received a cleaner visual style with clearer borders, subtle shadows, and consistent accent styling, and single-layer preview now matches multi-layer preview for smoother transitions.

* **Troubleshoot Center** by @yw4z in [12416](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/12416)
    Adds a new Troubleshoot Center, accessible from the Help menu, that gathers everything needed to diagnose problems in one place. It can save logs as a zip, set the log level, and copy auto-formatted system information (OS, CPU, RAM, GPU, monitors with resolution and scaling) ready to paste into a GitHub report. It also includes a profiles overview with enabled/total/user stats and a "Rebuild" button that safely clears the cached profiles folder and relaunches Orca. No user-specific information is collected, and system specs can be hidden before taking a screenshot.

    <img width="600" alt="Troubleshoot Center" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/779d80d5-f46c-4316-9920-8ea1127ce43e" />

* **Hide unsupported presets in the preset dropdown** by @Noisyfox in [13959](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13959)
    Unsupported presets are no longer shown in the preset combo boxes by default, keeping the dropdown lists focused on presets that actually apply to your setup. This also makes switching printers noticeably faster, especially if you have a large number of filament profiles. A developer setting can show unsupported presets again if needed.

* **Disable "Slow down for curled perimeters" by default and clarify its tooltip** by @igiannakas and @ianalexis in [13870](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13870) and [13918](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13918)
    This setting (ported from PrusaSlicer to help printers with weak part cooling avoid upward curling at sharp overhangs) is now off by default, because at today's faster print speeds it can cause wall-consistency artifacts unless pressure advance is carefully tuned. The tooltip was expanded with tuning recommendations so users who still want it know what to adjust. Printer profiles that explicitly enable it are unaffected.

* **New `--logfile` option to write diagnostics to a file** by @gloth-3ds in [13931](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13931)
    A new `--logfile <filename>` command-line option lets OrcaSlicer write log messages to a file. This is especially useful on Windows, where the windowed build provides no console, making it much easier to capture diagnostics for troubleshooting.

* **Add multiline fill to the infill type dropdown** by @RF47 in [13852](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13852)
    Adds the multiline fill pattern to the infill type selector in the UI, which was previously missing from the list. You can now select it directly without editing the configuration manually.

* **Allow wipe with firmware retraction** by @vovodroid in [13812](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13812)
    Wipe can be combined with firmware retraction only when retract-before-wipe is 100%. Orca now forces that value to 100% when firmware retraction is enabled, so wipe behaves correctly.

* **Unify the Setup Guide and standalone Printer/Filament selection dialogs** by @yw4z in [13579](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13579)
    Merges the duplicated code behind the Setup Guide and standalone versions of the Printer and Filament selection dialogs (removing roughly 2,200 lines of duplicate code) to make future development easier. Along the way it fixes the ESC key on the standalone dialog — the first ESC now closes the sidebar instead of the whole dialog — and resolves a few minor selection bugs.

* **OrcaSliced Handy Model** by @ianalexis in [13727](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13727), with a menu fix by @SoftFever in [14102](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14102)
    Adds a multi-color sample model — a stylized Orca on a pedestal alongside an Orca Cube — that showcases multi-color printing, auto-arrange, and loading multiple input files. Orca model by @RF47 (based on the logo by @jal-co), Orca Cube by @SoftFever, Orca text by @yw4z, and pedestal by @ianalexis.

    <img width="500" alt="OrcaSliced Handy Model" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78488467-da77-4079-914d-5d2234a9572e" />

## Bridging

A major bridging overhaul — a dedicated bridge line width, smarter bridge-angle controls, and a batch of reliability fixes for external, counterbore, and per-modifier bridges.

* **Dedicated bridge line width for stronger, better-bonded bridges** by @ianalexis, @RF47, @Noisyfox, and @valerii-bokhan in [11255](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/11255)
    Bridges previously reused the internal solid infill line width, which is usually wider than the nozzle and wrong for lines printed in mid-air with nothing to press against. This adds a separate bridge line width (capped at 100% of nozzle size) so each bridge line welds cleanly to its neighbor, improving bridge surface quality without increasing print time. Fixes #11209, #11412, #13106, and #10516.

    <img width="600" alt="Bridge line width setting" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bd9e37e-0d2d-467c-bc34-294620bb44f8" />

* **Relative bridge direction and align bridge/ironing angles to the model** by @ianalexis in [12055](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/12055)
    Adds a relative bridge direction mode so you can nudge the bridge angle by a few degrees to better cover a region instead of being locked to a single absolute angle. It also makes absolute bridge angles and ironing angles respect the "Align infill direction to model" option, so both now rotate with the part as expected. Fixes #12076.

* **More reliable external bridges on complex geometry** by @ianalexis and @RF47 in [12568](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/12568)
    Improves bridge region detection so external bridges form correctly on complex shapes, particularly where contours share vertices and micro-gaps between adjacent surfaces previously broke bridging. The result is more consistent, fully-formed external bridge surfaces. Fixes #11558.

    | Before | After |
    |--------|-------|

* **Fix stray bridge infill on top surfaces with "Extra bridge layers"** by @igiannakas in [13860](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13860)
    Fixes a bug where enabling Extra bridge layers could scatter bridge infill across the printed top surface of solid models, an issue that mainly showed up on Intel/Windows hosts. It also resolves several threading data races in the bridge and lightning-infill passes, making slicing more stable and producing deterministic, repeatable G-code for the same model and settings across platforms.

* **Fix counterbore hole bridging** by @kisslorand in [13956](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13956)
    Fixes two problems with bridges over counterbore holes: sacrificial bridges were being applied to holes that did not need them, and partial bridges could start or stop in mid-air, leaving gaps between the bridge and the wall. Now sacrificial bridges only go where required and partial bridges are properly anchored with clean gaps around the hole.

    | Sacrificial layer: before | After |
    |--------|-------|

* **Respect per-modifier bridge speed** by @kisslorand in [13971](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13971)
    Fixes internal and external bridge speeds set on modifier volumes not always being applied during slicing. It also corrects a sorting bug so overlapping model parts and modifiers are ordered more predictably. Fixes #13952.

    | External bridges: before | After |
    |--------|-------|

## Multi-Material

* **Add a "Default" filament option for per-feature filament settings** by @ianalexis in [13887](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13887)
    Introduces a new "Default" choice (filament index 0) for the wall, sparse infill, and solid infill filament options, which uses the active object's or part's filament instead of forcing a fixed filament number. Projects and profiles imported from versions older than 2.4.0 are automatically migrated so these options switch from 1 to 0. This makes per-object filament assignments more intuitive and consistent with support filament behavior. Fixes #13850.

* **Expand "filament for features" (per-feature filament assignment)** by @ianalexis in [13937](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13937), [14042](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14042), and [14033](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14033)
    Expands the per-feature filament capability — which lets you assign different filaments to individual object features such as inner/outer walls, top/bottom surfaces, and sparse/solid infill. It now works on single-extruder multi-material (SEMM) printers, offers more granular per-feature controls, and ships with updated profile versions.

    <img width="500" alt="Filament for features" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d8955ab-2cf9-4195-8b2a-e96e91dc892f" />

## Connectivity & Printer Hosts

* **Native Moonraker (Klipper) print host support** by @packerlschupfer in [13991](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13991)
    Adds a new "Moonraker (Klipper)" host type that speaks Moonraker's native REST API directly, rather than relying on the OctoPrint-emulation plugin. This means cleaner uploads and print starts for native Moonraker setups and Moonraker-compatible firmwares like the Prusa Buddy Klipper fork, including optional API-key auth and a storage-root picker. The existing "Octo/Klipper" entry is left untouched, so current setups keep working.

* **3DPrinterOS cloud host integration** by @3DPrinterOS-SDK in [10403](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/10403)
    Adds 3DPrinterOS as a new cloud host type, letting you send sliced jobs straight to your 3DPrinterOS account from OrcaSlicer. The integration handles login/logout, job upload with printer-type and project confirmation, and embeds the 3DPrinterOS web interface directly in the device tab — bringing managed, cloud-based print queuing to users on the platform without leaving the slicer.

    <img width="600" alt="3DPrinterOS login" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7a31567-0e15-4642-a8e6-e7e5ebe5c13a" />

* **Flashforge Adventurer 5 series local send with IFS slot mapping** by @marianomd in [12991](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/12991)
    Adds a LAN-based send workflow for the Flashforge Adventurer 5 series, including local printer discovery, saving the printer serial number and access code, and a Flashforge-specific send dialog. On the AD5X, you can map your project's materials to the IFS slots currently loaded in the printer before sending. Uploads use 3MF packaging to match the expected AD5X workflow, so prints correctly show remaining time on the printer display. This is local/LAN only and does not add cloud support.

    <img width="600" alt="Flashforge send dialog" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d544d7b7-2cf9-4cb7-ab10-310f309c8d54" />

* **Elegoo GIGA multi-printhead configuration** by @anjis-elegoo in [13901](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13901)
    Adds a "Number of GIGA printheads" option for the Elegoo GIGA, which runs multiple printheads in parallel on the same job. Selecting more printheads automatically shrinks the usable print area accordingly (full plate for one head, half for two, a quarter for more than two), and the exported G-code is tagged with the configured printhead count so the printer knows how the file was prepared. The option only appears when a GIGA printer is selected.

    <img width="600" alt="GIGA printhead configuration" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fb611d4-ba5a-4e91-a274-8044be93a34a" />

## Creality K-series

Comprehensive support for Creality's K-series printers, combining new connectivity features with a full profile refresh.

* **LAN discovery, CFS filament sync, and K-series filament profiles** by @grant0013, @imammedo, @hamham999, @alysandreollo, and @SoftFever in [13752](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13752)
    Adds end-to-end support for Creality K-series printers (K2 / K2 Plus / K2 Pro) when using the CrealityPrint host type. The Browse button now auto-discovers K-series printers on your local network, the sidebar can sync the filament slots loaded in the CFS into matching Orca presets, and around 110 K-series filament profiles are bundled (CR-PLA, CR-PETG, Hyper PLA, and more across all nozzle sizes). This builds on the CrealityPrint host-type foundation by @imammedo. Thanks to @swilsonnc, @DaviBe92, @Requiem-MH, @TrainAss, and @JoveYu for the work and testing that made it possible.

* **Refreshed Creality profiles and new printer support** by @hamham999 and @alysandreollo in [13947](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13947)
    Ports the latest Creality machine, process, and filament profiles from CrealityPrint v7.1.0, replacing outdated profiles that caused poor print quality and incorrect multicolor time estimates. Adds previously-missing printers — Creality SparkX i7, K2 SE, the K1 and K1 2025 CFS-C variants, Ender 3 V4, and Ender 5 Max — and includes OrcaSlicer compatibility fixes such as replacing the thumbnail schema that crashed Orca, enforcing the Arachne wall generator, and fixing multicolor printing for CFS/CFS-C printers.

* **Creality profile fixes and cleanup** by @hamham999 in [14073](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14073) and [14085](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14085)
    Follow-ups to the profile refresh: fixes the K2 Plus start G-code that used an unsupported `if multicolor` construct and caused slicing errors, removes leftover duplicate/outdated process files, and renames Creality processes to the standard scheme (SuperDetail, Fine, Optimal, Standard, Draft) so they are differentiated by layer height.

## Orca Cloud & Privacy

* **Guided resolution for cloud sync conflicts** by @peachismomo in [13900](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13900)
    Previously a sync conflict surfaced only as a confusing raw error. Orca now explains the conflict and offers two clear choices: pull the latest version from the cloud, or force push your local changes. This makes it much easier to recover when local and cloud presets diverge.

    | Pull from cloud | Force push |
    |--------|-------|
    | <img width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96aa8775-796a-489c-ade7-f6844ed05b1b" /> | <img width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38d280df-e500-4c59-a5ea-02368c9bb4c1" /> |

* **Stealth Mode improvements and a new "Hide login side panel" option** by @SoftFever in [13963](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13963)
    Clicking Login while in Stealth Mode now shows a dialog offering to quit Stealth Mode and proceed, instead of doing nothing silently, and the cloud login window centers on the main window rather than the primary display on multi-monitor setups. A new Preferences → Online option, "Hide login side panel," declutters the home page without enabling full Stealth Mode, and the Stealth Mode description now clarifies that it disables all cloud features including Orca Cloud profile syncing. The Health Management System (HMS) is also disabled when the Bambu Network plugin is not installed, avoiding needless network requests in offline/LAN-only setups.

* **Disable Bambu cloud telemetry before the network plugin starts** by @SoftFever in [13898](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13898)
    For improved privacy, Bambu cloud telemetry is now disabled before the Bambu Network plugin's startup runs, ensuring it cannot send telemetry during initialization.

# 🛠️ Bug Fixes

## Slicing, Supports & G-code

* **Fix Arachne duplicate extrusion on thin walls** by @akshimassar in [14031](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14031)
    Fixes a bug where the Arachne wall generator produced duplicate, overlapping extrusion paths on thin outer walls at certain minimum bead width settings. Thin walls now produce a single clean perimeter loop instead of two coinciding loops, improving print quality and avoiding over-extrusion. Fixes #13917.

* **Fix tree support top interfaces printing in thin air and unsupported edges** by @kisslorand in [14040](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14040)
    Resolves several tree-support interface problems: non-organic tree supports could print top interfaces floating in mid-air or over unsupported areas, organic tree supports could fail to generate a top interface at all, and non-organic tree supports left the edges of overhang areas only barely supported. Tree supports now reliably generate proper interfaces and fully fill overhang edges, producing more dependable supports and better surface quality.

* **Fix organic tree support drift and floating branches with rafts** by @kisslorand in [14069](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14069) and [14092](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14092)
    Fixes two issues with organic tree supports where branch paths could drift excessively during collision avoidance and smoothing, and where supports could appear floating or unsupported around the raft and early support layers when a raft was enabled. As a welcome side effect, generated supports are now noticeably smoother. A follow-up further refines this: the node-smoothing clamp is now relative, so it no longer pulls already-valid branches inward and collapses upper geometry, and layer-0 build-plate roots get a flat vertical foot to avoid malformed first-layer contours. Fixes #14036.

* **Fix organic tree support bottom interface layer count** by @kisslorand in [14095](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14095)
    Organic tree supports were not honoring the "Same as top" setting for the number of bottom interface layers. All support types now route through a shared helper so the bottom-interface fallback is applied consistently.

* **Fix crash when slicing with non-organic tree supports** by @kisslorand in [14074](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14074)
    Fixes cases where OrcaSlicer could crash during slicing when non-organic tree supports were used. Slicing now completes reliably with this support type instead of aborting.

* **Fix division-by-zero crash in organic tree support generation** by @kisslorand in [13936](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13936)
    Fixes an edge case where organic tree support generation could fail when certain support clearances were set to zero, which could cause division-by-zero and other invalid calculations. A small minimum value is now enforced only in this situation, and an internal safety flag is reset before each object so it no longer incorrectly carries over to other objects, re-slices, or other plates in a multi-plate project.

* **Fix overhang preview ignoring support threshold fallbacks at 0° angle** by @kisslorand in [12650](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/12650)
    When the support overhang threshold angle is set to 0, OrcaSlicer applies fallback rules during slicing (30° for tree supports, or a value derived from the overlap setting for normal supports), but the preview overhang highlighting previously used the raw 0° value. The preview now applies the same fallback logic, so highlighted overhangs correctly reflect where supports will actually be placed. Fixes #12634.

* **Fix inconsistent ordering of support base outline and fill** by @kisslorand in [11761](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/11761)
    Support bases are now generated deterministically, printing each base's outline first and immediately following it with its fill, instead of the order sometimes varying. Geometry, extrusion parameters, and visual output are unchanged. Fixes #10711.

* **Fix `total_toolchanges` placeholder reporting 0 without a wipe tower** by @mrmees in [13895](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13895)
    The `total_toolchanges` placeholder previously always returned 0 for prints without a wipe tower (such as manual M600 swaps or toolchanger/IDEX setups with the wipe tower disabled), breaking custom G-code and output filenames that relied on it. It now falls back to counting tool changes from the print's tool ordering, while leaving wipe-tower prints byte-for-byte unchanged.

* **Fix built-in placeholders missing from custom G-code and output filenames** by @mrmees in [13892](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13892)
    Fixes several documented placeholders that threw a "Variable does not exist" error in certain contexts. This restores `version` in custom G-code, the timestamp/date/time fields and `user` in the file-header G-code, and `initial_extruder`, `extruded_weight_total`, and `extruded_volume_total` in output filename formats. Fixes #12436 and #10708.

* **Fix air filtration G-code emitted on printers that don't support it** by @kisslorand in [13868](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13868)
    Orca no longer emits air filtration G-code when the printer profile does not support air filtration. Exhaust fan commands also now produce descriptive G-code comments when Verbose G-code is enabled. Fixes #13646.

* **Enhance G92 E0 case-sensitivity check** by @Wegerich in [13933](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13933)
    The G92 E0 check is now case sensitive and shows an error when incorrect casing (such as `G92 e0`) is used, catching a common custom G-code mistake.

* **Fix junction deviation and jerk settings behavior** by @kisslorand in [14004](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14004)
    On Marlin printers, junction deviation and jerk are mutually exclusive, but Orca could warn about a junction deviation mismatch even when junction deviation was disabled. The junction deviation control now appears only when the printer has it enabled (with jerk controls hidden), jerk settings are restored when it is disabled, and the mismatch warning is scoped to the active junction-deviation path. Fixes #14000.

## Interface & Usability

* **Fix color swatch not updating when a different filament is selected** by @igiannakas in [14038](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14038)
    Fixes the filament color swatch (the numbered button beside each sidebar filament dropdown) failing to update when you selected a different-colored filament preset. It now resolves the correct preset and refreshes the swatch reliably, including in the single-filament case.

* **Fix row spacing in the objects list** by @igiannakas in [14053](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14053)
    Restores the correct, compact objects-list row spacing that was broken after the wxWidgets update. Other widgets were unaffected.

* **Preserve Z scale when Ctrl-dragging an XY corner** by @Calcousin55 in [13840](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13840)
    When scaling with Ctrl+drag on a corner grabber, the scale was incorrectly applied to all three axes including Z. Now Ctrl+dragging a corner scales only X and Y while preserving the Z dimension and applying the correct offset, so just the corner moves. Normal (non-Ctrl) corner drag still scales uniformly.

* **Cut: account for X offset when checking multi-dovetail connectors** by @Noisyfox in [13945](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13945)
    Fixes the Cut tool so the X offset is properly considered when validating multiple dovetail connectors, preventing incorrect dovetail placement or validation when cutting objects. Fixes #13940.

* **Fix minor issues in the STEP import dialog** by @spr0u in [14067](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14067)
    Fixes the initial mesh face count occasionally cancelling before completion, and prevents the "Calculating, please wait…" text from being cut off.

* **Fix stuck hover state after opening the printer preset dialog** by @spr0u in [14082](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14082)
    Fixes the printer preset border highlight and edit button appearing stuck after opening the preset edit dialog on macOS.

* **Fix Print/Export dropdown closing before the cursor reaches the menu on macOS** by @JustNotesa in [13995](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13995)
    On macOS (since the wxWidgets 3.3 upgrade), the Print/Export split-button dropdown closed the instant the cursor entered the gap between the button and the menu, making "Export" impossible to select. The menu is now anchored flush against the button to remove the dead zone. Fixes #12936.

* **Fix filament group popup dismissed too quickly on macOS** by @Noisyfox in [13837](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13837)
    Fixes a macOS issue where the filament group popup would close before you could interact with it.

* **Fix incorrect grouping of custom printer profiles** by @igiannakas in [14044](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14044)
    Fixes custom printer profiles being lumped into an "unspecified" group because the printer preset list was incorrectly affected by the filament grouping selection. Custom printer profiles are now grouped correctly, restoring the 2.3.2 behavior.

* **Fix printer variant validation and errors in profiles** by @SoftFever in [14084](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14084)
    Adds a printer variant check to variant profiles and corrects printer variant errors present in existing profiles, improving the reliability of variant-based printer configurations.

* **Allow unchecking URL association in Preferences** by @SoftFever in [13899](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13899)
    URL association options in Preferences can now be unchecked. Fixes #13884.

## Stability & Crashes

* **Fix crash when deleting filaments after switching profiles** by @igiannakas in [14055](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14055)
    Fixes a crash that could occur when removing a filament after loading a project or switching to a printer profile with a different number of filaments, caused by the per-plate filament data going out of sync with the global filament count.

* **Fix crash with custom multi-extruder profiles based on a single-extruder printer** by @Noisyfox in [13896](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13896)
    Fixes a crash that could happen when you have a custom multi-extruder printer profile derived from a single-extruder (SEMM) base printer. The nozzle volume type list is now always sized correctly for the extruder count.

* **Fix crash when switching to a printer with fewer filaments** by @SoftFever in [14103](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14103)
    Switching to a printer with fewer filaments (for example from the H2D to the X2D) could throw an out-of-range error during filament-printable checks. Orca now clears stale per-volume extruder settings when the filament count shrinks and bounds-checks filament indices, so the switch completes without crashing.

    https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7191892b-df89-4cd4-92d7-7061809e171c

* **Fix crash loading a user preset with inconsistent per-variant settings** by @SoftFever in [14106](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14106)
    Fixes a crash when loading a user preset whose per-variant settings had mismatched sizes; such presets now load reliably. Fixes #13543.

## Connectivity & Cloud

* **Fix mDNS discovery on Windows PCs with multiple network adapters** by @AnyOldName3 in [13993](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13993)
    Resolves a regression where network printer discovery (mDNS) failed to find devices on Windows machines with multiple network adapters, often returning unusable IPv6-only addresses or broadcasting into the wrong adapter. Fixes #13969.

* **Fix CC2 device connection on Linux** by @anjis-elegoo in [14024](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14024)
    Fixes connection problems with the Elegoo Centauri Carbon 2 device panel on Linux by re-registering the webview script message handler, which could otherwise be dropped. The bundled WebUI is also updated to the latest version.

* **Fix CC2 device panel showing Offline by passing the printer serial** by @DeathKhan in [13878](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13878)
    Fixes the Elegoo Centauri Carbon 2 device tab incorrectly showing Offline even after a successful connection test. Orca now resolves and passes the printer serial number (caching it across restarts) so the device panel subscribes to the correct MQTT topics, which also removes an artificial ~10-second delay when opening the Device tab.

* **Fix web-page communication with native code on Windows** by @anjis-elegoo in [13829](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13829)
    Fixes a Windows issue where embedded web pages (such as printer device panels) lost the ability to communicate with native code after their scripts were reset, breaking interactive elements.

* **Preserve 3MF project settings when a cloud sync finishes** by @peachismomo in [13834](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13834)
    When a 3MF project was open and a cloud preset sync completed, the sync could overwrite the project's settings. Orca now restores any settings the sync touched, keeping your 3MF project intact.

* **Fix garbled non-ASCII Orca Cloud usernames** by @Noisyfox in [13856](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13856)
    Orca Cloud usernames containing non-ASCII characters (such as accented letters or CJK text) were displayed incorrectly in the UI, and now render properly. Fixes #13847.

* **Retry preset migration when login warmup blocks the cloud check** by @ExPikaPaka in [14049](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14049)
    Right after signing in, a brief window where the cloud session hasn't fully propagated could cause a 401 and silently skip migrating your existing local presets to Orca Cloud — making first-time users think their presets were lost. Orca now schedules a single deferred retry so the migration succeeds once the session is ready.

* **Don't log out of Orca Cloud on transient token-refresh failures** by @SoftFever in [14110](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14110)
    A temporary network glitch during an Orca Cloud token refresh could log you out unexpectedly. Transient refresh failures are now tolerated, so brief connectivity hiccups no longer end your cloud session.

## Calibration

* **Stop VFA calibration from disabling input shaping (Marlin 2)** by @Argolein in [14079](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14079)
    VFA calibration was incorrectly forcing input shaping off in the generated G-code, instead of only disabling resonance avoidance as intended. On printers like the Prusa Core One this caused layer shifts and hiccups. VFA calibration now leaves all input shaping settings untouched.

* **Fix false nozzle diameter mismatch error in manual calibration** by @SoftFever in [13882](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13882)
    Fixes Flow Rate and Flow Dynamics calibration failing on P1-series printers with a "nozzle diameter does not match" error even when the diameters matched and the UI showed nozzle info as synced. Manual calibration now starts correctly on these printers. Fixes #13798.

* **Fix nozzle diameter guards for printers that don't report nozzle info** by @cgarwood82 in [13255](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13255)
    Follow-up to #13330 for printers whose firmware doesn't report a nozzle diameter (Klipper/Moonraker, RepRapFirmware, Marlin). It stops spurious printer-mismatch prompts on every file load, lets the multi-extruder sidebar list sync when re-selecting a preset, and falls back to the selected preset's nozzle diameter so AMS and Calibration History filament lists populate correctly for older-firmware BBL printers with non-0.4 nozzles.

# 🐧 Linux

Linux-specific features and fixes — including several native Wayland improvements — gathered in one place.

* **Opt-in X11 backend to restore Device tab hardware acceleration** by @igiannakas in [14039](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14039)
    Wayland remains the default, but Linux users who hit native-Wayland bugs can now opt into the v2.3.2-style X11/XWayland path by setting `GDK_BACKEND=x11` in their launcher's `Exec=` line or environment. On this path WebKit compositing stays enabled, restoring hardware acceleration on the Device tab, Setup Wizard, and login pages, and fixing the 3D canvas covering the top/left toolbars on startup. Multi-monitor KDE Plasma users should stay on the Wayland default, where borderless XWayland can cause unregistered clicks.

* **Fix CPU spin in the Sidebar leave handler on inactive Wayland workspaces** by @d4not in [13897](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13897)
    Fixes a freeze where OrcaSlicer would peg a CPU core indefinitely after switching to another workspace on Wayland compositors (such as Hyprland, KDE Plasma, and Cinnamon) that keep windows mapped on inactive workspaces. Refs #11196, #12387, and #13067.

* **Fix freeze caused by the dynamically hidden printer edit button** by @spr0u in [14010](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14010)
    A follow-up to the Wayland freeze fix above: resolves a remaining UI freeze (seen primarily on Linux) that could occur when hovering the printer-preset edit button after scrolling down a settings tab. Refs #12387.

* **Fix non-functional OBJ import dialog on Linux** by @yw4z in [13914](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13914)
    Repairs the OBJ import (object color) dialog on Linux, where color buttons did not display their colors and the "view" combobox was unclickable. Fixes the spin-control sizing and several layout issues, including the view combobox overlapping the preview image.

* **Fix random startup crash on Linux** by @SoftFever in [14052](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14052)
    Resolves a sporadic crash while OrcaSlicer was launching on Linux. The splash screen could be dismissed by mouse or keyboard input and then accessed after it had already been destroyed; startup is now reliable even if you click or type while the splash screen is showing.

* **Fix crash from a temporary string going out of scope on Linux** by @peachismomo in [13925](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13925)
    Fixes an intermittent crash on Linux caused by a temporary text string being freed before it was used to set a label. Fixes #13831.

    Updates the Snapmaker U1 0.4 nozzle change-filament and machine-end G-code to track the height of all objects on the plate and lower the build plate to clear the tallest one, preventing the print head from colliding with previously printed objects during "Print by Object". A follow-up corrects a bad `G90` in the change-filament G-code and restores the measured head-clearance values, fixing collisions during material changes.
* **Fix Anycubic Kobra 3 Max bed exclusion zones** by @thelegendtubaguy in [13879](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13879)
    Corrects the bed size and exclusion zones so exclusion zones are now visible and auto-arrange works properly.
* **Remove hardcoded Qidi Max 4 input shaper** by @thelegendtubaguy in [13864](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/13864)
    The Qidi Max 4 now uses the input shaper values determined during its own machine calibration instead of a hardcoded algorithm.
